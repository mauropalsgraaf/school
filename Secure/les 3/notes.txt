Security is layers (top to bottom):
- Cryptography
- Bugs
- Network security
  -> Firewalls
  -> IDS
  -> AV
  -> VPN

Code based cryptography, since quantom computers will break the current cryptography

CVE = Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
CWE = Common Weakness Enumeration

IMPORTANT: What is exploit and vulnerabilities

Tainted input = input from user that can be injected in the app (untrusted)

code                |
initialized data    |
uninitialized data  |
heap                |
stack               (arrow down)

Problem: Heap and stack are both dynamic, we dont know the size of the heap.

Solution

code                | }
initialized data    | } This is all fixed memory
uninitialized data  | }
heap                (arrow down)
stack               (arrow up)

The stack goes bottom up, heap goes up to bottom
