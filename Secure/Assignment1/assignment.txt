a) A
b) B
c) D

2 For both answers of question 2, two scripts are provided (written in PHP) on how I got the result

a) this is a simple message encrypted with a simple cryptographic algorithm
b) this is a simple message encrypted with an improved cryptographic algorithm

Script that provides the answer for question 2a is called decipher.php which is in the root of the archive
Script that provides the answer for question 2b is called decipher2.php which is in the root of the archive

It requires java8 to be installed. Since Java8 functions are used, any version below Java8 will not fit the
requirements.

To check if Java8 is installed and on your system PATH variable, please run java -version in the terminal.

To run, run the following command: java -jar playfair.jar ${key} ${message} ${mode}

replace ${key} with 25 characters from the alphabet where they should all be unique, also, the j should be missing.
example: abcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxyz. This key transforms to the following key used for the playfair cipher

|a, b, c, d, e| 1-5 letters of the provided key
|f, g, h, i, k| 6-10 letters of the provided key
|l, m, n, o, p| 11-15 letters of the provided key
|q, r, s, t, u| 16-20 letters of the provided key
|v, w, x, y, z| 21-25 letters of the provided key

replace ${message} with the message that you want to do an operation on
example: message
Spaces are not allowed.

replace ${mode} with either ENCRYPT or DECRYPT

By executing, the terminal will return the result of the operation executed on the provided message.

I've used Java to implement the PlayFair Cipher. The source code can be found in the cryptography directory, which can
be found in the root of the provided archive.

I've created an interactive filevault where it is possible to create new files and read files from the vault.

To run, run the following command in the root of the provided archive: java -jar filevault.jar

This command will start an interactive shell session which will contain guidance on how to create new files and read encrypted files

The code is provided in a folder which can be found in the root of the directory.
